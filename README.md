# Learn the Hard Way - Selenium

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) was originally developed by [Jason Huggins] in 2004 as an internal tool at [ThoughtWorks]. 

[Simon Stewart] at ThoughtWorks developed a superior browser automation tool called [WebDriver]. In 2009, after a meeting between the developers at the Google Test Automation Conference, it was decided to merge the two projects, and call the new project Selenium WebDriver, or Selenium 2.0.
